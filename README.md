# Repair-Tool

A program that niceley packages some of windows' builtin functions that fix your computer. With a bit of extra functionality built in.

## Requires Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2019

For the (deprecated) simplified version, please go to: [https://github.com/ANONYMOUSEJR/WIN10-Repair-Tool]

### NOTE:
This program may be seen as a virus by your AV this is because it uses functions such as system() which basically allow the use of stuff from the windows terminal, this is neccessary because I use Microsoft's functions such as DISM.
